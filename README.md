If you want to create a simple catalog for an entity, you must enter the console the following command:

```bash
    php artisan make:scaffold Category --fields="name:string:100[required|alpha]"
```

```bash
    php artisan make:scaffold Customer --fields="rfc:string:13[required|maxlength:13|minlength:12], first_name:string:100[required|alpha], last_name:string:100[required|alpha], email:string:100[required|email]"
```

This will create the bass for a Customer model structure, will be created the following files:

```txt
    Controller:
        app/Http/CustomersController.php
    Model:
        app/Models/Customer.php
    Migration:
        database/migrations/0000_00_00_000000_create_customers_table.php
    Seed:
        database/seeds/CustomersSeeder.php
    Lang:
        resources/lang/en/customers.php
        resources/lang/es/customers.php
    Views:
        resources/views/customers/index.blade.php
        resources/views/customers/new.blade.php
        resources/views/customers/edit.blade.php
    Routes:

After running the command: make:scaffold, we should run a migrate and if necessary run the seeder that just generated.

    php artisan migrate
```

```bash
    php artisan db:seed --class=CustomersSeeder
